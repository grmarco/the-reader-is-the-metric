Presumably she was in the hospital to give birth, but she goes home and her real baby is already at home. It's also unclear why she should have more flow of breast milk because two different babies were nursing. Presumably this would happen if two babies were nursing at the same time, but not if two different babies nursed at two different times. The long-term emotional attachment the woman has to the brown-eyed baby also seems unrealistic. I didn't understand why she continued to be so profoundly attached to him over the long term."

They are at a showing of Grace's artwork, so why does the old man say that Lily is an extraordinary artist? Presumably, her artwork is not on the wall. Besides, Grace is not her biological daughter, so how did Lily pass on her own mother's talent to her daughter?

She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.\") Although all of the characters mostly align with one another -- they all hate the construction and want it to end -- those perspectives were, I felt, conveyed convincingly and accurately."

The ending didn't really have much resonance for me as a reader--mainly because the narrator said things to make the reader believe that the stakes were high (e.g., the father's illness and the precariousness of those in the gay community), but, as a reader, I never really could FEEL that the stakes were high. (I'll save more on this for the scene v summary question later.)"

I've just read it, and I'm a pretty careful reader, but if you asked me to name some particular moments from the story, it'd be difficult beyond that necklace/disco ball comparison at the beginning; the fact that the father was wearing white jeans (which felt like a peak-80s/90s detail--lovely) at one of the dances, and her dress at the ending. I think this is in large part due to the lack of slowing down into scene throughout this story. We never get dialogue except some sort of throw-away \"You here by yourself?\" dialogue with Claire and something about where they live with random, undeveloped high boy. Partly because of this, I don't feel like I have a felt sense of this narrator really at all. I *believe* that she could be a dynamic, rich character that we could care about, but I don't right now really at all, and I think that's due in large part to how expository the story is."

Even those moments that I feel like *would* be slowed down for dramatic effect (e.g., when the narrator finally meets Tom in the gift shop with Claire) just aren't; everything feels slightly rushed and glossed here in this story, and as a result, moments like that ending--which I think is supposed to be a moment in which the reader feels something--fall flat."

However, the story itself doesn't proceed in this way; I think we're meant to believe that the trip was meaningful, transformative, something for the narrator--but instead, it just feels like the moment that spurs the entry into talking about the speaker's family, rather than anything more meaningful. Nothing in the story feels surprising beyond the initial situation of it, which again, feels novel and compelling (but underdeveloped)."

There's something akin to cliche that does happen a lot, though, and I don't know exactly what to call it, but it's in telling the reader too explicitly what the story means or is supposed to mean. It's like the story doesn't trust the reader enough \"get\" it--which, to one of my students, I'd encourage them to make sure they develop the story enough so that they CAN trust the reader enough that they'll \"get\" whatever it is. An example in the story is when the narrator says, \"This was their turf; I was just a visitor. More liberated than at school, but still an outsider, and, because I had always lived in a state of hiding a huge part of my identity\u2014my family story\u2014I questioned my very self.\" Bleh.

Starting in some sort of scene--and ending in a scene, of course--is delightful, but the scenes themselves are not developed enough to feel like it's actually fully a scene in either case, and the drifting back from the opening paragraph into explanation of the family/etc. seems expected and underwhelming."

But I do think, overall, that some of the narrator's insights (e.g., that she felt most \"at home\" in this place among gay men, even though she herself wasn't a gay man; that she could see the toll this cultural moment of the late 80s/early 90s was having on these men; that she found companionship and understanding supposedly from people like Claire and Tom) could feel unique or original, depending on the readership."

Now, I could make the case that the thin-ness of his character as described or experienced by the daughter makes good sense given the way we see she's been made to conform to his life--but this is a stretch for the story as it's written now, and isn't supported by other aspects of the story."

The car had flown off the road into the underbrush, making a disastrous impact with such velocity that it wrapped around a tree.\" Did he see the car swerving, or did he see it in the underbrush? Later, we understand he must have seen it resting, but this raises another problem, because we are told about the woman: \"It was possible she had been in such a state for days or even weeks.\" This is confusing when we learn later that the men looking for the accident had just been told about it, presumably because someone had witnessed it just happen.

He whipped out his cellphone but there was no signal. Holding back panic, he checked for a pulse multiple times, to no avail. Her pale face was marred with rivulets of dried blood, her limp body twisted in a way that signaled her neck was likely broken.\"). This serves to break the believability of the story. (The other notable instance of this was when the narrator says that the accident must have just happened, but then John feels her \"cold, clammy skin.\") While these elements might not seem strictly related to pacing, they make the story hiccup weirdly, and pull out out of the story-world into the world in which we're reading a story (which works against the suspension of disbelief that comes with fine writing)."

In other words, the cadence of the narrator's description and pacing don't change when it comes to these moments, and as a result, what I think is supposed to feel like a vigil for the dead, an act of compassion for a stranger, instead ends up feeling so interior and unremarkable."

Maybe the invisible translator got distracted, lighting a cigarette or eating a sandwich, or maybe he was so taken by the action in the movie that he was suddenly unable to speak. Then the voice would come back and rush through long scenes in a few breathless lines.\" Oh, my gosh.

For example: \"They were buried six feet under in a whirlpool of suspicion and confusion, waves of uncertainty lapping against the shores of their tender hearts.\" Here we have a burial, which takes place underground, but here the burial is in a whirlpool. Furthermore, a whirlpool doesn't create lapping waves on the shore, but rather a strong vortex.

Asking the salesgirl her opinion about what young professional women wore to the o\ufb00ice these days.

From the very beginning, the narrator adding that \"he had this beautiful coat, the kind of fabric that made you want to reach out and touch\" gives us a kind of look into her mind: her attention to detail, her observing of others, her lack of self-consciousness to describe it as \"beautiful.\" As a reader, I immediately know that this is a narrator I want to listen to. Also, to start a story with the weirdness of \"I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of someone like Miss Emily. It never occurred to me to imagine her,\" I know as a reader that I'm in excellent hands. \n\nMiss Emily is the most unlikeable character of course (and moreso as the story continues), but because of the way we see our narrator having affection for her in the beginning, despite Miss Emily's obvious condescension, the \"betrayal\" of her change is all the more arresting.

There was no pretending\"; \"But I didn\u2019t think of things like that, impressions\u2014first impressions\u2014what they mean and how people don\u2019t change their feelings about you even years after.\" \n\nAs mentioned earlier, I am really smitten with the way the author sets up the idea of Miss Emily seeing herself as gatekeeper or restorer with the anecdote that \"she said her son was always finding things like that\u2014dead animals, caps and bottles, old books\u2014and bringing them home. She said he always asked her to make something out of them.\" Similarly, the narrator seeing the story as a place where \"You didn\u2019t have to own any land or take out feed or work up the nerve to kill anything that had a face. Someone somewhere did that work for you, and it was all there on display\" reveals much to the reader about her anxieties and struggles."

And when the narrator says, earlyish in the story, that Miss Emily \"was so wonderful to me, really,\" it's protesting enough to let us know that, when combined with the beginning statement about Miss Emily, all is not what it seems--or won't be what is seems like now by the ending. I love that the person she married is just \"the son\" or \"Miss Emily's son\"--it's a brilliant way to show us that his purpose in the story is to get us to the conflict between these two characters, and even the narrator seems aware here."

Most people would expect a pregnant woman to appreciate being steered away from violence, but Barbara resists - and the reader roots for her in that moment. When she speaks up for the murderer at a family event later, it satisfies the reader's desire for Barbara to become a fully actualized woman, freed from the constraints placed on her by Howard and society.."

The reader infers that the things that made Barbara different from all the other women in the narrator's life made her an inspirational figure. From this we gain a slim, but meaningful insight into the narrator's own life, constraints, and desires. This is an excellent essay."

Additionally, the essay repeatedly attempts to end several times, each time building on itself in superficial ways using similar language: As the years passed, Barbara became a beacon of hope (how?); In the decades that followed, Barbara's story became a legend (why?); As the world continued to grapple...Barbara Adler's legacy lived on; Years later, (Barbara's unnamed son) grew up to become a remarkable individual...an advocate for peace...carrying his mother's story with him; Generations passed, and each one carried forward the tale of Barbara Adler...

Rabbi Adler seems to have been shot at the front of the synagogue, but then Barbara reaches for him as though he were seated near her, then she moves forward to confront the gunman to prevent further tragedy, but also maybe her husband, who was already shot? The essay then asserts an impact and renown of Barbara's actions that seem totally out of proportion to what she did, which appears to have been a trite internal realization that carrying on after a tragedy is an act of strength. It is unclear how raising her child was received as an act of forgiveness for her husband's murderer, or what form her advocacy took, or why it turned her into a legend."

But it is unclear which is the new rabbi, or if perhaps they are even the same character? At the same time we are introduced to an Isaac Adler, who appears to be a young child. The story is full of confusing details (\"this young man...was accompanied by a great, mysterious beast, beautiful in its terrible symmetry\"). I cannot make sense of its ending, in which Rabbi Adler vanishes with puffs of cold breath as the mysterious young man chants what I assume is a religious verse while raising his hand that (maybe?) holds a gun. I do not understand what actually happens in this piece, which seems to end at an arbitrary point."

The focus on Barbara, the creep forward of the service, the details all point us toward the fact that something is unsettled and that the story is counting down to something--and then the way that the author uses punctuation to slow us down as we get to the climactic moment? DYNAMITE:\n\n\"Barbara is too far away to see what\u2019s in his hand, and after he fires a single shot into the ceiling the sound is so alien to the space, so incomprehensible, that it takes Barbara a moment to start to register what has just happened, and even then she isn\u2019t sure, in the jittery quiet that follows, exactly what\u2019s going on.\" The interrupted syntax here is so purposeful and excellent."

I especially was wowed by the building of subtext here: \"The force of the crowd trying to get out was too strong, and she was thrust into the parking lot and the thick, unworldly silence that still coats stories of that sunny February morning, even as car doors slammed and engines rasped to life and distant sirens moved closer."

This is also partly the problem of those weird transitionary phrases I mentioned above; we're actually supposed to believe that the story of this woman, which I'm afraid here is super forgettable, inspired people for not only years but \"centuries [...] guiding countless souls through their darkest hours, and reminding humanity of its capacity for resilience, compassion, and love\"? I don't believe it for a second, I'm afraid. Those entire 17 \"ending\" paragraphs are clumsily expansive in terms of time compression and thin on details of why anyone would actually remember her story.

I already don't trust it; between the cliches and the boring way it's laid out, this feels like the early ideas of a story rather than a story itself."

While it is itself a hackneyed writing workshop phrase, this story struggles greatly in showing emotion to the reader as opposed to telling them. It is a strange reality to narrative and perhaps to life in general that feints and gestures can be more moving and communicate more clearly than outright statements."

Without any interplay between the way the narrator depicts herself or her mother and the way the reader reads the situation, without leaving anything unsaid, it is much more challenging for the narrative to find nuance within its characters or its narrative."

It feels more like a failure of execution than of intention. There are some other moments where the pacing is manipulated impressively.

Although, to be clear, the conventionality of the structure is not, to me, necessarily a statement on originality.

The writer's attention here to the paragraph is also key when it comes to the story's pacing; the way the writer keeps the reader moving through the story with very short paragraphs peppered in through the longer paragraphs is strategically handled, and the variation between the length of paragraphs does much to both pull us through the story while also \"putting on the brakes\" as the reader is forced to move in and out of multiple paragraphs."

        "explanation": "Yes; this test criterion was a little tricky for me for this story because the story itself has a formality to it, the feeling of translation. (Obviously I don't know that this was *actually* translated from a language other than English, but the syntax feels of another language, and the diction and register of the the narrator make it feel to me like the reader is getting it in translation.) At any rate, because of the formal feeling of the narrator's voice here--and even the ways the characters speak to one another--I didn't find a lot of idiom or metaphor to be had. But certainly nothing stood out as diverging from the tone or mood of the narrator's voice here, and what idiomatic language there was felt successful. A sentence such as \"This time, once again, I felt that I was leaving badly, in a cowardly way\" feels *just* askew enough in its phrasing (\"leaving badly, in a cowardly way\") that it sounds like translation--and translated beautifully, of course, and using vernacular believably."

This relates to structure in part, too, but the way the writer blends scene and summary is so careful and balanced; a paragraph like the one about visiting old people's houses shows how seamlessly the narrator moves between exteriority and interiority As is the case in living as well, there's no \"distinction\" between what's happening and how the narrator is seeing or interpreting it; there's a natural-feeling movement from exterior to interior without feeling forced or, worst, feeling like we're only getting the exterior in order to give an excuse to get to the interior."

For me as a reader, the turns here are interior and understated; the turns happen through information and backstory that's meted out patiently for the reader (e.g., \"[t]he other tone, the violence from when I was fifteen, would not return\" and the accompanying snippets of dialogue). It's as if the narrator has nothing but time for the reader, which contrasts beautifully with the impatience and dutifulness underlying the daughter's visit with the mother."

It's a hard narrative move to pull off, but I think it's done really well here. A few moments that show off the writer's ability to cover large temporal distances with blinding efficiency: \"At the same time, she was firing off questions about my trip, the children, the dog. She didn\u2019t answer mine. Afraid of being boring, always, when speaking of herself. Later, she repeated, as usual, \"I\u2019m fine here. Couldn\u2019t be better and 'I have no complaints."

I feel confident that the writer here could have given us paragraphs and paragraphs of description that would feel right and true; instead, they only give us the exact amount of description that's needed to build up both the diegetic sound and point us, gently, toward subtext and meaning (e.g., \"The TV was on without sound, just the test pattern on the screen.\")"

There's also some sort of pragmatic/logistical weirdness at times in which the narrator says things that make neither actual nor figurative sense; the most egregious in my view is the sort of nonsensical \"call back\" to the problematic sun description from earlier: \"The sun no longer posed a threat, for I was there to shield her from its harsh rays, to protect her from harm.\" What does this mean? The literal sun? (Has she no sunscreen, no hat, no sunbrella?) Some...figurative sun that hasn't been touched on yet, and never will be?

Instead of ending on resolution of some sort, or answers, the story leaves us with more questions. Are these particularly generative, compelling questions? No. But I have to give the story credit for subverting our expectation that the story might be neatly closed by the ending."

This feels unique and like a fascinating way to think about personal histories, and the ways our memory betrays us, focused as it always is by our present circumstances. But then, the narrator's perverse self-importance gets the better of him, and we suffer under sentences like these: \"For as complicated as the tapestry of our intertwined lives may have been, and as diverse as our shared experiences often proved to be, it gradually dawned upon me....\" Bleh. The narrator here is too clever by half, and the story struggles because of it."

I very well might be on board as a reader with some portion of that, but the layering of words and sensations ends up making the language itself somewhat meaningless.

But never, ever do we see anything come of this; the mystery that could've grown--and added to this character's complexity and believability--is cut out at the root by the pretentious musings of this narrator. We all know pompous people, of course; but even the most conspicuously showy among us would be hard pressed to say \"Calms, too, were restored upon the earth and in the heavens. What a strange experience it was to accompany my mother once more\" while keeping a straight face. The narrator is a caricature, and the mother is merely an old mother, and that's that.

It was a silent invitation to embrace the enigmatic connection she felt, to dance with them in the face of the unforgiving storm.\n\nAnd so, in a city awoken by catastrophe, a discarded chair, a couple entwined in ethereal dance, and an observer entranced by it all, converged. The floodwaters had receded, but a deeper connection had risen from the depths of chaos, forever etching itself into the fabric of their lives.\n\nEvelyn stepped across the threshold, venturing into the sanctuary of their apartment. The couple welcomed her with open arms, as if they had been awaiting her arrival. They introduced themselves as Clara and Samuel, two wanderers who found solace in the art of connection.\"\n\nThe dialogue and interactions are glossed over; we don't get a specific sense of a scene unfolding so much as a summary."

Its pages were filled with sketches and poems, recounting the tale of a couple who forged an unbreakable bond in the midst of a devastating fire.

A malicious inner turmoil forced him to confront the gnawing question of whether to maintain his doubts or to give in to that spark of romanticism. Did she mean the sun melting the water and evaporating it, boiling the ocean's organisms into a state of life-extinction, or drying up the world until it became nothing but black sores of star-dust and cosmic desolation?\n\nDel shifted on his knees and glanced down at his toes, where bits of seafoam playfully tickled the wet hairs. Dismissing his skepticism, he stifled his anxieties and decided to accept it as a poetic image. Putting on a brave smile, he said, \"That's beautiful.\"\nIf intended as comedy, it is great, Del is utterly unaware about Heather's romantic take on the situation, has no idea what she is talking about, and yet manages to say something obliquely romantic as well. Was comedy the intention of the author (or the artificial intelligence that produced this)? I'm not sure."

It seems like a real narrator would think or comment on different things, not just the shoulders over and over again.

I'm a sucker for fairytales, and so I'll admit that anything that plays with that genre is automatically interesting for me. But what I think makes this actually work well, though, is that way that the seeming at-odds-ness of the first two fairytale paragraphs with most of the rest of the story; the only other part of the story that gives me an inkling that there's something else at work here is when the narrator says, \"Whenever I try to tell anyone about Q\u2014to describe him as a person\u2014I feel totally helpless. I\u2019ve never been very good at explaining anything, but, even taking that into account, it\u2019s a special challenge to try to explain Q to someone. And when I do try I\u2019m overcome by a deep, deep sense of despair.\" The stakes here seem SO HIGH--out of measure for the task, at least with what we know about the narrator and Q so far. It's a weird detail, and one that I'm really intrigued by. The story itself has the quality of having been translated--expertly, down to the easy use of idioms--from a language other than English. The syntax itself feels like syntax borrowed from a non-English language, too, though I could be wrong here, of course."

The poolside seating area was tiled with mesmerizing blue oblongs the size of postage stamps, the patterns of which continued up the sturdy pillars supporting the roof overhead. // In the clear water, a wispy white cloud of chlorine billowed serenely out of a small cluster of pipes.\" What the what?
